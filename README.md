# React Portfolio

## About

This is a version of my professional portfolio, compiled with React.js. My goal was to take the information I have already given on my original portfolio, and then present it using a technology I have recently learned. 

There is a static header and footer on each page. The tabs at the top will allow the user to navigate through different components.

This portfolio is deployed on GitHub pages, and can be accessed [here](https://ksdevinney.github.io/react-portfolio/).
